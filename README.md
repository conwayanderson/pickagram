# django-boilerplate

This is my django-boilerplate, there are many like it but this one is mine. The
point of my boilerplate is to have separate requirements and settings for my
three environments:

 + Production
 + Development
 + Jenkins

Most Django boilerplates have the first two but all lack Jenkins settings and I
really like Jenkins...

## Build Status

You can check the latest version of django-boilerplate's build status on my
[personal Jenkins server][0]. This lets you if the master branch actually works.
It also lets you know my pep8 and pylint conformance along with my test code
coverage. (See, isn't this cool!)
